### OReilly Football Analytics with Python & R, Eager & Erickson
These are the personal notes, under MIT license of Paul Richeson, Dec 4th, 2023.
Chapter 1 Notes: 
 - MIT and Carnegie Mellon students got interested in football statistics, speicially the average Target Distance, and argressiveness compromises for exprexted point posibilities. NFL Scapper, NFL Faster, written in R. 
 - Baseball uses Walks, Strikeouts, Homeruns. Stability and repeatable is best.
 - RYOE - Rushing Yards Over Expected (RYOE)
 - Some players are stable, some players are risky.
 - What is a running back?
 - It is safer now that we use the forward pass. Throwing the football is faster than running.
 - NCAA Southeastern Conference Football. This includes texas.
 - A running back runs the football.
 - Using metrics like Yards Per Play or EPA
 - EPA football, expected points added, it is a scalar of points for the team. if it was 7 is it max?
 - The book could be said to argue that running backs do not have high market value.
 - Air Yards, Distance traveled from the line of scrimmage to the line of receiver. slightly less than the actual throw length.
 - Completion percentage over expected. quarterback metric
 - Bad draft picks from coahes can be a problem solved using calculations of draft capital. Picks, Pick rounds, Pick Numbers. 
 - Common Data Languages R, Julia, Python
 - Funny data languages Matlab, SaS, Jupiter.
 - Julia, is a math language, high level.
 - R, Python and Open source licenses get along with the football community it seems. check for libraries in python.
 - Insert coke or ford advertisement here.
 - If someone gives you data, and they generate a model with excel, it is best if they know their stuff. Use R or python if you care about posterity.
