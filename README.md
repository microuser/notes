### OReilly Football Analytics with Python & R, Eager & Erickson
These are the personal notes, under MIT license of Paul Richeson, Dec 4th, 2023.
Chapter 1 Notes: 
 - MIT and Carnegie Mellon students got interested in football statistics, speicially the average Target Distance, and argressiveness compromises for exprexted point posibilities. NFL Scapper, NFL Faster, written in R. 
 - Baseball uses Walks, Strikeouts, Homeruns. Stability and repeatable is best.
 - RYOE - Rushing Yards Over Expected (RYOE)
 - Some players are stable, some players are risky.
 - What is a running back?
 - It is safer now that we use the forward pass. Throwing the football is faster than running.
 - NCAA Southeastern Conference Football. This includes texas.
 - A running back runs the football.
 - Using metrics like Yards Per Play or EPA
 - EPA football, expected points added, it is a scalar of points for the team. if it was 7 is it max?
 - The book could be said to argue that running backs do not have high market value.
 - Air Yards, Distance traveled from the line of scrimmage to the line of receiver. slightly less than the actual throw length.
 - Completion percentage over expected. quarterback metric
 - Bad draft picks from coahes can be a problem solved using calculations of draft capital. Picks, Pick rounds, Pick Numbers. 
 - Common Data Languages R, Julia, Python
 - Funny data languages Matlab, SaS, Jupiter.
 - Julia, is a math language, high level.
 - R, Python and Open source licenses get along with the football community it seems. check for libraries in python.
 - Insert coke or ford advertisement here.
 - If someone gives you data, and they generate a model with excel, it is best if they know their stuff. Use R or python if you care about posterity.
 ```py

 - ignore all install pip, python, conda, npm, nvm, instructions, invest your own with nix.
  ```nix.conf
python3
julia

```
 - i like fluent code.
 - Key by name and number
 - value by number of plays and (adot) mean air yards per pass.
 - filter to include > 100 plays, and skip incomplete rows
 - never double negative. Only postive perspective.
 - its obvious that a quarterback who throws to a receiver who then can run is better than just a quarterback who throws to a receiver who sticks still.
 - the book declares that I have whet my appetite for using math to examine football data. indeed.
 - the R system of pipes is like linux, but with better symbols.
 - nflfastR is a package you should import in python
 - using filter() in R or query() for a subset of data. Or even, vlookup.
 - using summarize in group by.
 - Openion: WHy don't they nosql it? with queries. am i reinvting nosql? how is this not MongoDb.
 - a dataframe, is what I often call the Item object, the ith value in the itterated list.  A row . aka.
